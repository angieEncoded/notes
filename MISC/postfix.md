# Postfix notes

- Setting up out of office
    - ssh into the server
    ```cd /home/username```
    - there are two files -
        - .forward and .msg
        - Edit .msg to say what you want
        - .forward needs to be named as .forward in order to work
        - Rename it to dotforward to turn off the out of office again
