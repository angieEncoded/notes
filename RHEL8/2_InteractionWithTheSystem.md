# Chapter 2 - Initial interaction with the system

- Linux graphical environment
    - Wayland
        - Display protocol
        - Replaces the legacy X window system
    - Two necessary components
        - Display manager - or a login manager
        - Desktop environment
- Display\Login manager
    - Handles the login screen
    - Default is GNOME Display Manager (GDM)
    - Presents a list of all normal user accounts
    - Click 'not listed' to login as root
- Desktop Environment
    - Once user is validated, the display manager establishes a desktop environment
    - Point and click GUI
- Linux directory structure and file systems
    - FHS - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is used
    - Root directory is /
    - Paren directories stem from this
    - Child\sub directories stem from that
- Top-level directories
    - Static and dynamic data
        - System processes will update dynamic data
    - Static directories normally have commands, config files, libs, kernel files, dev files, etc
    - Dynamic directories have logs, status files, temp files, etc
- Filesystem Categories
    - Disk based
        - Created on physical media
    - Network based
        - Essentially disk-based that is shared over the network 
    - MEmory based
        - Virtual - created at startup and destroyed at shutdown
    - During installation two disk-based systems are created
        - root
        - boot
- root file system /
    - Top level filesystem
    - Holds many higher level directories
        - /etc (extended text configuration)
            - Holds config files
            - /systemd - configuration files
            - /sysconfig - system services
            - /lvm - logical volume management
            - /skel - per-user shell startup templates
        - /root
            - The default home directory of the root user
        - /mnt
            - mount points for other filesystems
- Boot file system /boot
    - Has the kernel, boot support files, and config files
- Home directory /home
    - Stores user contents
    - Each user gets their own directory
- Optional directori /opt
    - Additional software that might be installed on the system
