- Packet Crafting
  - a technique that allows someone to generate a network packet with specific data
  - When you might want to do this
    - Set unusual TCP flags to see how a firewall respondes
      - Xmas tree attack
        - sets flags FIN, URG, PSH all set to on
        - lights up light a Christmas Tree
        - Most modern firewalls won't fall for this trick
    - Fragment packets
      - Try to sneak them by an IPS
      - Or create something that can't be reassembled to soak up resources
  - Goal is to use as few packets as possible

| Assemble      |   Creates packet to be sent                                           |
| Edit          |   Modify the contents of the created packet                           |
| Play          |   Send or resend that packet onto the network                         |   
| Decode        |   Capture and analyze traffic generated by the packet sent (wireshark)|
