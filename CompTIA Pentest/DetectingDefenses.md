- Load Balancer
  - Core networking solution that disrtributes traffic
  - Great for orgs - multiple servers answer up as a single server
  - Use LBD to detect whether one is in use
  - lbd <URLTOTEST>
  - ```lbd diontraining.com```
- Firewalls
  - Network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoign network traffic
  - Detect with a traceroute
  - If you see stars instead of responses, that's a firewall or some other security device
  - firewalk <PORTS> <INTERFACE> <TARGET>
  - ```firewalk -S8079-8081 -i eth0 -n pTCP 192.168.1.1 162.168.0.1```
    - determine what layer 4 protocols a given firewall will pass along
    - passed TCP or UDP packets that have a TTL one hope greater than expected
  - WAF - Web Application Firewall
    - Montiro web applications and protect against them
    - CSS, SQL Injjection, etc.

    - Use obfuscation to confuse them
- Antivirus
  - Used to prevent, scan, detect and delete viruses and malware
  - Metamorphic viruses are harder for AV to detect
    - Most of them are based on signatures
  - Obfuscating known signatures with specialized tools
  - Use special tools and payloads that use Fileless malware
    - Powershell scripts
    - cmdlets
    - Bash utilities
    - Another form of 'living off the land'
- Encryption
  - Makes it harder to detect
  - A stub will decrypt and execute when it's on the target machines
  - process injection\process hollowing
