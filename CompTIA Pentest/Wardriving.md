- Wardriving
  - Focused on wireless networks
  - Drive near a facility looking for wireless networks
  - Used to be just car driving, now we have War Walking
  - Look for open WAPS
  - Closed encrypted access points
  - In general, wireless are less secure
    - WPA3 is much more secure than before
  - Device configurations
    - Verify where the devices are, what protections are in place, and are they adequately secured

    - All the wifi networks all over the place
  - dBi - Decibels Per Isotropic
    - The strength of an antenna in terms of how good it can listen and collect information
    - 2 dBi < 5 dBi antenna
    - Omnidirectional
      - Even with a higher dBi you get a shorter distance
    - Dipole antenna\Bidirectional
      - Two way antenna, slightly stronger than the Omnidirectional
    - Unidirectional
      - The best you can get, strongest signal in a direction
      - You can look directly at your target org
  - SNR - Signal to noise ration
    - Measures the wireles signal strenght in relation to the background noise
    - If you have a weak signal and high noise you either need a stronger antenna or you need to get closer to the source
  - If you are doing wardriving or warwalking, use an omnidirectional antenna
- Note that there are more networks out there than just WiFi
  - Microwave links can provide internet
  - Uses a parabolic antenna that has a curved surface with a fixed pattern that points to the ISP and connects a point to point link between the ISP and the client to provide fast internet speed
  - Satellite links are the other option
